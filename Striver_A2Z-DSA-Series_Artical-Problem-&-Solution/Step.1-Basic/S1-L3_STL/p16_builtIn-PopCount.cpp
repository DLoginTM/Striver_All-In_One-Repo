/**
    Note:
    The problem of counting set bits in an integer means finding
    the number of 1’s in its binary representation.

    For example, the binary form of 7 is 111, which has 3 set bits.
*/

/**
    //Native Solution:
    int count_setbits(int N) {
        int cnt = 0;

        while (N > 0) {
            cnt += (N & 1);  // check last bit
            N = N >> 1;      // right shift
        }
        return cnt;
    }

    Keep checking the least significant bit using bitwise AND with 1.
    Right shift the number by 1 to move to the next bit.
    Continue until the number becomes 0.
    Increment count for each set bit encountered.



    //Using __builtin_popcount():
    C++ provides a built-in function __builtin_popcount()
    that counts the number of set bits in a single line of code.

    Syntax: __builtin_popcount(int num);

    Works only for integers within the int range.

    int main() {
        int n = 7;
        cout << __builtin_popcount(n);
        return 0;
    }


    //For Long integer:
    If the number is of type long long and does not fit into an int, we use __builtin_popcountll(). Notice the ll at the end of the function name.

    Example:
    int main() {
        long long n = 77777777777777;
        cout << __builtin_popcountll(n);
        return 0;
    }


    __builtin_popcount() → works for int type.
    __builtin_popcountll() → works for long long type.
